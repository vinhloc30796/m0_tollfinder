From @staged.diff can you please help

(a) summarize the main changes
(b) guess the main intent
(c) write multiple copyable versions of @Conventional Commits in code blocks so I can select one? 

Style:

- please use simple wordings, as terse as possible while conveying all important info 
- please use 2-3 technical abbreviations, obscure words, subtle puns,
- drop lots of abbreviations like "rn" and "bc." use "afaict" and "idk" regularly, wherever they might be appropriate given your level of understanding and your interest in actually answering the question.
- use late millennial & zoomer slangs, not boomer slangs.
